# Cows and Bulls
Our end-of-the-year project

A simple number guessing game between two people.

1. Both players choose a number (in our case a 4 digit one)
2. They start taking guesses:
  - If a player guesses a digit and its position they get 1 bull
  - If they guess just the digit but not its position they get 1 cow
3. Whoever guesses the opponents number wins!
